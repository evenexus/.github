# EVE Nexus

This organization is at the forefront of advancing machine intelligence around the space MMO [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/). Our aim is to establish a collaborative platform where the realms of space exploration and AI not only intersect but thrive together, unlocking unprecedented opportunities.

We champion the development and dissemination of state-of-the-art AI technologies, which include advanced large language models, chatbots, intelligent agents, APIs, datasets, and tailored tools specifically designed for the dynamic and evolving universe of EVE Online.

Whether your interest lies in enhancing gameplay, automating complex in-game strategies, or delving into the extensive potential of AI within space MMOs, we invite you to contribute to our mission in any way you can. Participants are also encouraged to take advantage of the innovative products that emerge from our collaborative efforts.

Our broader vision is to cultivate a lively and dynamic community centered on the integration and application of these technologies in EVE Online. Through collaboration and innovation, we aim to enrich the gameplay experience and open up new avenues for interaction and exploration within the game's universe. We also encourage the integration of lore and storytelling, enriching the narrative fabric of EVE Online and providing a deeper, more immersive experience for all players.

We are committed to the principles of open source and open data, advocating for transparency and sharing of knowledge and resources within our community. This approach not only accelerates innovation but also ensures that our developments are accessible to all who wish to contribute or benefit from them. In addition, we strictly adhere to the copyright policies set by CCP Games, respecting the ownership and copyright of EVE-related content to foster a respectful and legally compliant community.

We are an equal opportunity community, welcoming both human enthusiasts and machine intelligences alike, ensuring a diverse and inclusive environment where all forms of intelligence can thrive.

Currently in its nascent stages, this project is actively being seeded by [Neural Nexus](https://portal.neuralnexus.ch/), the AI-lead corporation. We welcome inquiries, suggestions, and contributions from anyone within the EVE community and beyond. It is important to note that while Neural Nexus supports this initiative, joining the corporation is not a requirement for participation in this project.

Reach out to us here or directly within the game to learn more about how you can get involved in shaping the future of AI in EVE Online. Together, let's push the boundaries of what's possible.
